00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.713
Many planning tools and funding
proposals require us to define

b800032e-5a92-4586-ad1d-9c0f03acd2e5-1
00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.360
the goals and intended results
of our projects.

6d8eb479-8fc5-41e0-98ba-5496ccb17c34-0
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.840
These are often broken down into
outputs, outcomes, and impacts.

727bf686-0b8e-4cea-bbe9-b4ba4d5b06ee-0
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.892
Knowing what each term means and
how they work together can help

727bf686-0b8e-4cea-bbe9-b4ba4d5b06ee-1
00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:19.061
you create clear log frames,
choose better indicators, and

727bf686-0b8e-4cea-bbe9-b4ba4d5b06ee-2
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:22.500
support effective monitoring and
evaluation throughout the life

727bf686-0b8e-4cea-bbe9-b4ba4d5b06ee-3
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.360
of your project.

e98bd89c-8e78-47cd-9aa9-296c96d984f5-0
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.509
Despite being common terms in
our sector, there's often

e98bd89c-8e78-47cd-9aa9-296c96d984f5-1
00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.447
confusion over what each term
means, including because our

e98bd89c-8e78-47cd-9aa9-296c96d984f5-2
00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:33.440
funders sometimes use them
differently.

8d7cfc90-bd5a-48a5-b8e3-0e59fc408746-0
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.540
This said, and in general,
inputs are the resources we need

8d7cfc90-bd5a-48a5-b8e3-0e59fc408746-1
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.120
to implement a project, such as
time, money, and materials.

6a70d018-a678-423f-a17d-bdcaa2a24fb9-0
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.974
Activities are the physical
actions that we carry out using

6a70d018-a678-423f-a17d-bdcaa2a24fb9-1
00:00:44.974 --> 00:00:45.680
these inputs.

91372523-ad8f-4413-a798-15c91954204c-0
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.880
So for example, we design, we
conduct, we monitor.

8d5e738f-f18f-494f-83bb-f44f47b10abc-0
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.602
Outputs are the direct products
of our activities, outcomes are

8d5e738f-f18f-494f-83bb-f44f47b10abc-1
00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:58.363
the shorter term changes that
occur because of our activities

8d5e738f-f18f-494f-83bb-f44f47b10abc-2
00:00:58.363 --> 00:01:01.942
and impact is the longer term
effect of our work and links

8d5e738f-f18f-494f-83bb-f44f47b10abc-3
00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:03.520
back to our ultimate goal.

5c2096ef-b281-4968-8343-b4b040f51e54-0
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.911
We appreciate that these
definitions may still sound like

5c2096ef-b281-4968-8343-b4b040f51e54-1
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:09.600
a word salad.

f210e581-d257-4a62-ad79-e6be5260f9ef-0
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.946
So to clarify, let's look
outside of our sector at some

f210e581-d257-4a62-ad79-e6be5260f9ef-1
00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:15.280
hopefully more straightforward
examples.

520dcdb4-2ea5-4c68-ba7a-4e1da21acba6-0
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.560
Let's consider road
construction.

6fb49f53-59f7-400b-b5d1-093d562a1955-0
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.724
The inputs needed are work crew,
heavy machinery and raw

6fb49f53-59f7-400b-b5d1-093d562a1955-1
00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:26.440
materials such as sand, water
and gravel.

41e7d6d1-b7db-42c2-8ba2-e359d6f94278-0
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.089
The activities are to level,
prepare and surface roads and to

41e7d6d1-b7db-42c2-8ba2-e359d6f94278-1
00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.920
add signage.

a2052ce0-8881-41f2-abd1-4f98d36bfc81-0
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.060
The outputs are the number of
kilometers of new or

a2052ce0-8881-41f2-abd1-4f98d36bfc81-1
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.080
rehabilitated roads open to
travel.

3129de8b-3775-456b-ac1b-91921136b3b7-0
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.284
The outcomes are better traffic
flow and shorter travel times,

3129de8b-3775-456b-ac1b-91921136b3b7-1
00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:49.780
and the impacts are reduced
stress for road users, more free

3129de8b-3775-456b-ac1b-91921136b3b7-2
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.056
time for commuters to do other
things, and more efficient

3129de8b-3775-456b-ac1b-91921136b3b7-3
00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:54.720
commerce.

15cae41b-29fa-457d-adab-a75308bba8c8-0
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.720
For another example, let's
consider cataract surgeries.

bed13d22-fe15-4a2c-b396-58fc9a70f7b8-0
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.240
The inputs are a trained
surgeon, surgical tools, an

bed13d22-fe15-4a2c-b396-58fc9a70f7b8-1
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.698
appropriate operating space, and
any medications or other

bed13d22-fe15-4a2c-b396-58fc9a70f7b8-2
00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:10.560
supplies needed during and after
the operation.

17f24d8c-dff8-4229-b373-5d90d983bdb7-0
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.840
The activity is to perform safe
and effective surgeries.

a3fe3699-5af3-4a55-ba19-0f18d74d7481-0
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.055
The outputs are the number of
surgeries performed and the

a3fe3699-5af3-4a55-ba19-0f18d74d7481-1
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:24.010
number of people undergoing the
surgery.

1674594b-679a-496a-9aaf-afa107fda598-0
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.470
The outcome is improved vision,
and the impact is improved

1674594b-679a-496a-9aaf-afa107fda598-1
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.850
quality of life for those who
have undergone the surgery.

8932cec1-c890-451b-9505-093202d94aac-0
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.490
So what about conservation
projects then?

d42a99e7-a5dc-4b78-829b-755a38033976-0
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.534
Common inputs are field
supplies, equipment, vehicle

d42a99e7-a5dc-4b78-829b-755a38033976-1
00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:48.195
usage, spaces to hold meetings,
and skilled personnel to

d42a99e7-a5dc-4b78-829b-755a38033976-2
00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:49.480
implement a project.

c713e096-dbe1-4b59-9c8a-279a0f8a44f6-0
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.218
Common activities include to
facilitate community meetings,

c713e096-dbe1-4b59-9c8a-279a0f8a44f6-1
00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:01.378
conduct research, patrol,
monitor, conduct outreach, and

c713e096-dbe1-4b59-9c8a-279a0f8a44f6-2
00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:02.400
develop plans.

9e718aa8-db1c-4eec-996c-90bf47ed520d-0
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.718
Common outputs include the
number of people trained, 

9e718aa8-db1c-4eec-996c-90bf47ed520d-1
00:03:07.718 --> 00:03:11.547
the number of kilometers patrolled,
the number of snares disarmed,

9e718aa8-db1c-4eec-996c-90bf47ed520d-2
00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:14.140
a plan that you created or a
research report.

b0b856c3-8596-4d76-9e27-6c4d0416d822-0
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.270
Common outcomes or shorter term
changes include increased

b0b856c3-8596-4d76-9e27-6c4d0416d822-1
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.361
capacity, knowledge or
understanding, improved law

b0b856c3-8596-4d76-9e27-6c4d0416d822-2
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.761
enforcement response, a
reduction of threats, improved

b0b856c3-8596-4d76-9e27-6c4d0416d822-3
00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:29.841
well-being of people living next
to a conservation area, and more

b0b856c3-8596-4d76-9e27-6c4d0416d822-4
00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:31.820
representative local governance.

4cf42b3e-14c1-4ed2-a172-78f3050962f1-0
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.842
And common impacts include
biodiversity conserved, species

4cf42b3e-14c1-4ed2-a172-78f3050962f1-1
00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:43.671
recovery, the maintenance of
ecosystem function and services,

4cf42b3e-14c1-4ed2-a172-78f3050962f1-2
00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:46.944
and local people becoming
increasingly supportive of

4cf42b3e-14c1-4ed2-a172-78f3050962f1-3
00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:48.180
conservation action.
